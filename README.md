# EC601 Project - FPGA vs. GPU for Machine Learning
## Product Mission
To Compare and benchmark FPGA vs GPU Execution speed on cloud platforms
## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The minimum viable product is code and test results
## User story
- A machine learning developer wants to develop an application that requires a fast execution speed and needs to decide between FPGA and GPU.
- A machine learning developer wants to verify the performance of a particular cloud computing service that supports tensorflow frameworks
## Technologies to evaluate and reason for choosing
Framework
- Tensorflow: open source, developed and used by Google, wide range of tutorials, documentation and support
Platform=Amazon Web Services.....familiarity, support.
- EC2 F1 instances
- Sagemaker
- To investigate BU Compute platform
### Tests
### Results
